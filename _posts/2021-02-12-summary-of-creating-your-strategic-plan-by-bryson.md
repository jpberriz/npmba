This is the workbook companion to ["Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations" by John M. Bryson](summary-of-strategic-planning-for-public-and-nonprofit-organizations-by-john-bryson).  The biggest value of the workbook is the worksheets and templates it gives you for every step of the strategic planning process described in ["Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations" by John M. Bryson](summary-of-strategic-planning-for-public-and-nonprofit-organizations-by-john-bryson). If you found that book to be a good fit for your strategic planning needs then you will appreciate this companion book.
