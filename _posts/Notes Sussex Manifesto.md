### Using technology, knowledge, and innovation management to build a nonprofit capacity assessment tool

Years ago, I was lucky to be part of a team that trained and consulted for small and medium businesses on Technology, Knowledge and Innovation Management. In the team, my role was to write the project documents. Another team member - Luis Miguel Abad - was the expert on technology, knowledge and innovation management, and I learned a great deal from him. His lessons influenced my work  greatly. Since then, when I'm tasked with building an organization, I always approach it from the perspective of technology, knowledge and innovation management. 

Today, I'm creating an Extended Capacity Assessment Tool for nonprofits. I've gone so far as to determine the core functional areas of a nonprofit that should be assessed. I've also identified the components of each of these functional areas. 

I've started incorporating the technology, knowledge and innovation management approach, and I'm encountering some obstacles. So, as I usually solve problems, I'm diving into the topic, starting with the sources that my colleague shared with me, and going from there.



***My goal with this research is to find indicators to measure growth in a nonprofit's capacity to carry out its core functions. And to be able to explain why those are appropriate and useful indicators.***




### The origin: Sussex Manifesto

It seemed to have all started with a group of academics working at the University of Sussex who were asked by the United Nations to make recommendations on how science and technology can support development efforts. Their report, the *Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade*, which was rejected because it was considered to "radical" became known as the *Sussex Manifesto*.

  > This paper reviews [the proposals of the 1970 Sussex Manifesto] and examines, as far as possible, the extent to which they have been realized in the subsequent forty years. It highlights continuing and new challenges now facing innovation policy, and indicates ways in which some of the original manifesto’s ideas may be extended to address today’s urgent problems. It then outlines additional considerations that would need to be addressed in considering the manifesto’s relevance to contemporary issues about innovation, sustainability and development.

#### Notes from read about the Sussex Manifesto

Central idea: developing countries need to build their capacity to produce science and technology.

Science: the means to understand the natural environment.

Technology: the means to control and exploit the natural environment.

#### Conclusion: moving on

I've dedicated some hours to find and review the literature that my colleague - mentioned above, Luis Miguel Abad - referred to when we worked together. Most of this literature refers to the ability of firms in developing countries to accumulate technological capabilities.   

I found the Sussex manifesto's propositions and the thinking that it generated to be fascinating. 

One thing about the literature I found threw me off. There is a sudden change in language. I couldn't find the conceptual ground on which this change is supported. More recent papers (2009 and 2010) on the topic refer to "innovation capabilities" while the original Sussex manifesto referred to "technological capabilities".  I wish I could interview someone from Sussex and ask. As far as I know, they both refer to similar processes that point at the ability of an organization to improve what it does. Nevertheless, while I couldn't find an explanation for the change in language, it seems clear that it's about "innovation" now. 

In any case, this has been an interesting dive, but I don't think it's going to help me on my goal to define how to measure a nonprofit's capacity to carry out its core functions. I'm moving on to look into some sources about innovation management.
