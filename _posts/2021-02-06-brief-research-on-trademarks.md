## Resources:

[United States Patent and Trademark Office](https://www.uspto.gov/), great to look up patents and trademarks.

[This webpage](https://www.names4brands.com/trademark-class-search.php#google_vignette) is a good resource to get an overview of trademark classes. 

This is the [USPTO webpage][https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=login&p_lang=english&p_d=trmk] to search for a trademark, and these are the suggested [steps][https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/support-centers/patent-and-trademark-resource-centers-ptrc/resources] to follow.

A good list of the different classes is [here][https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/trademark-updates-and-announcements/nice-agreement-tenth-edition-general-remarks-class], and a searchable list by keyword of the classes is [here][https://idm-tmng.uspto.gov/id-master-list-public.html]

[These][https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/apply/initial-application-forms] are the instructions to file a trademark.
