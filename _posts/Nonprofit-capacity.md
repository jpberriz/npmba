nonprofit capacity - what is it exactly

technological capabilities - how does pavel define it? 

are technological capabilities the same or similar than innovation capabilities, should I use that instead?

how does nonprofit capacity compare to technological or innovation capabililities?

what are the variables of technological or innovation capabilities that we can use to assess the capability of a firm/ nonprofit? hopefully by functional area
