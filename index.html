<p>Hi, I was the Executive Director of a small nonprofit for several years. During that time, I developed a framework to help me manage the organization.</p>
<p>I think it can be useful to you.</p>
<p>So I'm sharing it here.</p>
<p>Sign up to my email list so I can let you know you when I add content.</p>
