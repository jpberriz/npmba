> ### The Nonprofit.MBA is for managers and leaders that want to build and grow their organizations to make the world a better place.

## Start here:

1. Use the Quick Capacity Assessment Tool (QCAT).  You will receive a two-page report with results that will give you an overview of your organization's capacity by functional area, and help you quickly identify where most capacity building work is needed. 

2. Sign up for updates so you are notified about our next Nonprofit Capacity Building Workshop, where you will learn to use our Nonprofit Capacity Building Framework to build and grow your nonprofit.

## We are preparing to offer: 

* A Workshop on Nonprofit Innovation Management.
* A Learning Community of peers that are building and growing their nonprofits. 
* A Nonprofit.MBA Book that will serve you as a reference manual.
* A Knowledge Repository for you to browse and use for your daily work.
